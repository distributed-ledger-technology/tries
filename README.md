# Tries
[Tries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3CbFFVHQrk4) are data structures that can be used to store sequences - e.g. words as sequences of letters.  
Tries support faster and more precise query executions related to those sequences.  

## Usage Examples

Please check the [unit tests](https://github.com/distributed-ledger-technology/tries/blob/main/src/trie.spec.ts) to explore usage examples
